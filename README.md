# CalibrationValidationDSGE_MCS_ICA
Here is possible to find the codes I'm using for my Master thesis. The thesis is about calibration and validation of DSGE models using the Model Confidence Set, where I will exploit the ICA theory for the identification of SVAR model.

## Matlab_Code
Inside this folder is possible to find the code needed for the simulation of the DSGE model. 

## R_Code
Inside this folder is possible to find the code with all the analysis:
- Real Data elaboration and analysis
- Simulated Data elaboration and analysis
- Calibration through MCS
